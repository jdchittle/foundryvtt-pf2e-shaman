Your proficiency ranks for spell attacks and spell DCs for your shaman spellcasting increase to legendary.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Totem's Gift<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>Your patron grants you the power to command incredible works of magic. You gain a single 10th-level spell slot and can prepare a spell in that slot using shaman spellcasting. Unlike with other spell slots, these spell slots can't be used for abilities that let you cast spells without expending spell slots or abilities that give you more spell slots.
